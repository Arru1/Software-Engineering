Yoobee College database is being developed to streamline the management of the academic data and student information. The system will track students, courses, departments, lecturers, class enrollments, and grades. The primary goal of the database is to manage student registration, course enrollment, grading, and lecturer assignments efficiently, while ensuring that data integrity and consistency are maintained. The system will support key functions for students, lecturers, and administrators, making it easier to handle daily academic operations such as managing course offerings, tracking student progress, and handling faculty assignments.
